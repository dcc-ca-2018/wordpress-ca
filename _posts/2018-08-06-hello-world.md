<strong>Cravebusters is a platform to order home food from passionate cooks based out of Dublin, Ireland. Cravebusters was inspired by the thought of providing a complete food ordering solution from the best neighbourhood chefs/passionate cooks. A single window for ordering from a wide range of chefs/passionate cooks, who are enthusiastic and passionate about cooking and deliver their delicacies all by themselves. Once the customer chooses the food they want to order they get to contact the chef and customise the food just as they want. Our aim is to get the authentic home food to the doorstep of our customers or foodies across Dublin.</strong>
